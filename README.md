# overview-mcp

**Give Claude eyes on Earth.** An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server plus a live
mission-control dashboard — **the data layer for the Earth system**, over free, open data.
Ask Claude to look at a place and it pulls satellite imagery, computes vegetation/water/burn
indices, surfaces live wildfires and disasters, and diffs a location across time to detect
deforestation, flooding, or burn scars. Ask it about the planet and it tracks El Niño,
ocean temperatures since 1981, CO₂ since 1958, the global temperature record since 1880,
polar sea ice, earthquakes, air quality, and per-place climate history since 1940 — with
trends, because the historic record is where the signal lives. As it works, a browser
dashboard lights up with what it's seeing.

> Claude is the brain; the dashboard is the canvas. The MCP best-effort streams every
> result to a local dashboard you watch live — but it works perfectly with the dashboard
> off too.

## Try it in 30 seconds (zero keys, zero config)

```bash
npx -y overview-mcp demo
```

That's it. A dashboard opens in your browser and fills with the planet, live: CO₂, global
temperature, El Niño state, Arctic sea ice, this week's earthquakes, and every open natural
disaster — charts, markers, and a vital-signs grid on a satellite map. No account, no key,
no config file. (Needs Node ≥ 20.)

## Use it from Claude (one command)

```bash
claude mcp add overview -- npx -y overview-mcp
```

Then just ask: *"What's the state of the planet right now?"* · *"Is El Niño coming?"* ·
*"How has Berlin's climate changed since 1950?"* · *"Any big earthquakes this week?"*

## What it can do

| Tool | What it does | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eo_snapshot` | Quick satellite image of a bbox (NASA Worldview/GIBS, MODIS/VIIRS) — true-color, false-color, or fire overlay | — |
| `events` | Live natural-disaster events worldwide (NASA EONET): wildfires, storms, volcanoes, floods | — |
| `geo_resolve` | Turn a place name into a bounding box (OpenStreetMap) | — |
| `stac_search` | Search open satellite archives (Sentinel-2/-1, Landsat) for scenes + COG asset URLs (Earth Search STAC) | — |
| `fires_in` | Active fire / thermal-anomaly detections (NASA FIRMS), near-real-time | `FIRMS_MAP_KEY` |
| `eo_render` | High-res (10 m) Sentinel-2 imagery — trueColor / falseColor / NDVI ramp | CDSE |
| `sar_render` | All-weather Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter (sees through cloud/smoke/night) — VV / VH / false-color | CDSE |
| `sar_water` | All-weather water / flood extent from Sentinel-1 (water % of the AOI via low VV backscatter) | CDSE |
| `sar_flood` | Flood onset: SAR water extent before vs after an event, and the change (Δ water %) | CDSE |
| `eo_index` | NDVI / NDWI / NBR statistics over a least-cloudy Sentinel-2 composite | CDSE |
| `eo_search` | Search the Sentinel-2 archive for scenes + cloud cover | CDSE |
| `eo_compare` | Change detection: render two dates + the index delta (deforestation/flood/burn) | CDSE |

### Planetary indicators — the Earth system over time (all zero-key)

| Tool | What it does | History |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `planet_pulse` | The planet's vital signs in one call: CO₂, global temp, ENSO, sea ice, quakes, open disasters | now |
| `enso` | El Niño / La Niña tracking via NOAA's official Oceanic Niño Index, with phase + event rule | 1950→ |
| `ocean_temp` | Daily sea-surface temperature for any ocean point (NOAA OISST 0.25°), with °C/decade trend | 1981→ |
| `co2` | Atmospheric CO₂ at Mauna Loa (the Keeling curve) — latest, YoY growth, decadal trend | 1958→ |
| `global_temp` | NASA GISTEMP global temperature anomaly — latest, warmest years, warming rate | 1880→ |
| `sea_ice` | Arctic / Antarctic daily sea-ice extent (NSIDC) vs the 1981–2010 climatology | 1978→ |
| `quakes` | Recent earthquakes (USGS): magnitude, depth, tsunami flag, PAGER alert | real-time |
| `climate_history` | How a place's climate changed: ERA5 temperature/precip/wind, annual trend per decade | 1940→ |
| `air_quality` | PM2.5 / PM10 / O₃ / NO₂ / US AQI for any point (Copernicus CAMS), WHO-guideline flags | 48 h |
| `river_discharge` | Daily river flow at any point (GloFAS) — flood/drought signal vs the period mean | 1984→ |

The Earth is one interconnected system — and these tools are built to be cross-referenced:
ENSO ↔ fires, floods and SST anomalies; river discharge ↔ SAR flood mapping; climate trends
↔ what the imagery shows on the ground.

Every Copernicus result (`eo_render`/`eo_index`/`eo_compare`) carries a **provenance block**
— data source, sensor, composite window, cloud-mask method + masked classes, % valid pixels,
contributing scene IDs — so the output is decision-support you can audit, not a bare number.
Every indicator result names its source and carries the series, so claims are checkable.

The zero-key tools (`eo_snapshot`, `events`, `geo_resolve`, `stac_search`, and all ten
planetary-indicator tools) work with no setup at all.

## Setup details

Want the dashboard alongside Claude? Run `npx -y overview-mcp dashboard`
in a second terminal and watch the map light up as Claude works (it's optional — tools
behave identically without it).

## Unlock the satellite tools (2 free keys, ~5 minutes)

14 of the 22 tools need nothing. The rest want free credentials:

| Key | Unlocks | How to get it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FIRMS_MAP_KEY` | `fires_in` (live wildfire detections) | Enter your email at [firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/map_key](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/map_key/) — emailed instantly |
| `CDSE_CLIENT_ID` + `CDSE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `eo_render`, `eo_index`, `eo_search`, `eo_compare`, `sar_render`, `sar_water`, `sar_flood` (10 m Sentinel imagery + radar) | Free account at [dataspace.copernicus.eu](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) → User Settings → **OAuth clients** → Create (copy the secret immediately — it's shown once) |

Pass them where your MCP client expects env vars, e.g.:

```bash
claude mcp add overview -e FIRMS_MAP_KEY=xxx -e CDSE_CLIENT_ID=xxx -e CDSE_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx \
  -- npx -y overview-mcp
```

Then verify everything in one shot:

```bash
npx -y overview-mcp doctor
```

```
  Zero-key data sources: ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓
  Optional keys:
    ✓ Copernicus CDSE   OAuth token OK
    ✓ NASA FIRMS        key valid (0/5000 transactions used)
  All zero-key sources reachable — 22/22 tools ready to use.
```

`doctor` checks every upstream source and tells you exactly what's ready and what's missing
(with the link to fix it). See [.env.example](.env.example) for all variables.

## The dashboard

Each tool posts a "card" — imagery overlays and NDVI/index panels render on a MapLibre map
(NASA Blue Marble basemap), events/fires/earthquakes plot as markers, time-series tools draw
charts (the Keeling curve, ONI, sea-ice vs climatology…), `planet_pulse` shows a vital-signs
grid, and `eo_compare` shows a before/after pair with the delta. The push is best-effort: if
the dashboard isn't running, tools behave exactly the same.

## Example sessions

> **You:** What's the NDVI around Manaus, and how has the forest changed since 2019?

Claude calls `geo_resolve("Manaus, Brazil")` → bbox, then `eo_index(bbox, "NDVI")` →
mean ≈ 0.28, then `eo_compare(bbox, "2019-08-01", "2026-06-01", "NDVI")` → renders both
dates and reports the NDVI delta. Meanwhile the dashboard shows the imagery, the index
panel, and the before/after comparison.

> **You:** Is the Rio Negro flooding right now?

Claude calls `river_discharge(-3.1, -60)` → latest flow 2.5× the 2-year mean (rising-water
season), then confirms from orbit with `sar_flood` → water extent +2 pts since April. Two
independent instruments, one answer — that's the point of having the whole Earth system in
one toolbox.

> **You:** What's the state of the planet?

One `planet_pulse` call: CO₂ 432 ppm (+1.8 YoY), global anomaly +1.12 °C, ENSO neutral,
both poles' sea ice below the 10th percentile, 70 quakes M5+ this week, 200 open disasters
— each with its source named.

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build            # tsc (server -> dist/) + vite build (web -> dist/web/)
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test             # offline test suite (node:test) — no network or API keys needed
pnpm dev              # MCP server on stdio (from source)
pnpm dev:dashboard    # dashboard server (from source)
pnpm dev:web          # vite dev server for the dashboard UI
```

Tests mock the network, so the whole suite runs with zero credentials — CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck + test + build on every push.
